# groundfailure

Introduction
------------
groundfailure is a project designed to implement as many methods for calculating landslide and liquefaction probability 
given an input ShakeMap.  

Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------
This package depends on a number of other libraries, most of which are installed with Anaconda.  We strongly suggest that
users install that software or one of the other Scipy Stack distributions described here:

http://www.scipy.org/install.html

Some of those that may not be installed with a distribution:

 - configobj (installed with Anaconda)
 - fiona

Usually these packages can be installed with either conda (Anaconda installs) or pip.

The final dependency, mapio, can be installed with:

pip install git+git://github.com/usgs/MapIO.git  

To install this package:

pip install git+git://github.com/usgs/groundfailure.git

To upgrade this package:

pip install -U git+git://github.com/usgs/groundfailure.git

For gdalfuncs to work (find proj.4 libraries), you may need to add the following line to your .bash_profile:
export PROJSO=/Library/Frameworks/PROJ.framework/PROJ

Configuration
-------------

Configuration options, such as the output directory, paths to input data files, model coefficients, and map display options
are all set in a configuration file found in ~/.groundfailure/config.ini.
Since many of these options depend on local paths, you need to create and modify this file youself.
The format is described below along with a template. 

The config file format is a modified version of the "INI" format.  It is described in detail here:

http://configobj.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configobj.html#config-files

**Notes** 
- The configuration below does not represent any valid landslide or liquefaction model.  The parameters
and layers are shown here for the purpose of explaining how to configure models. 
- References and other inputs with commas within them need to be enclosed in quotes or else they will not be read in properly (commas will be used to separate) - for example: 'Verdin, D.W., Godt, J., Funk, C., Pedreros, D., Worstell, B. and Verdin, J., 2007, Development of a global slope dataset for estimation of landslide occurrence resulting from earthquakes: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2007–1188, 25p.'
- Arrays should be not be enclosed in brackets and should be comma separated, for example: model = 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.99, 1.
- Files, filepaths, and folders for different input and data layers should only include the object's location within the input folder indicated at the top of the file.

API for Model Output
---------------------

Each model should output a single dictionary, which has keys that correspond to the names of the 
input and output layers from the model.

Each layer in the dictionary is itself a dictionary, with the following fields:
 - *description* A dictionary with the fields:

   * *name* Short name, suitable for use as a plot title if necessary.
   * *longref* Full citation, USGS format as described here: http://internal.usgs.gov/publishing/sta/sta28.pdf
   * *units* Physical units for input data layers, and one of the following for output "probability" layers:

     * *index* Relative (low to high) index of occurrence in a given cell (not necessarily bounded).
     * *probability* Probability of event (landslide,liquefaction) of a given size occurring in a given cell (0 to 1).
     * *coverage* Fractional coverage of groundfailure in a given cell (0 to 1).
     * *displacement* Distance material will move from or in given cell (unbounded).

   * *parameters* (Not required for input layers) A dictionary of key/value pairs, where the values must be either numbers or strings.

 - *type* Indicates whether this grid contains input data or output from a model.

 - *label* What will be written next to the colorbar for the data layer.

 - *grid* Input data or model output, in the form of a Grid2D object. 

A template model function implementation is shown below.
